    <h3>So now to come to the real question of <span class="h3bold">punctuation, periods, commas, colons, semi-colons</span> and <span class="h3bold">capitals</span> and <span class="h3bold">small letters.</span></h3>
    <h3>I have had a long and complicated life with all these.</h3>
    <h3>Let us begin with these I use the least first and these are <span class="h3bold">colons</span> and <span class="h3bold">semi-colons</span>, one might add to these commas.</h3>
    <h3>When I first began writing,</h3>
    <h3>I felt that writing should go on,</h3>
    <h3>I still do feel that it should go on </h3>
    <h3>but when I first began writing</h3>
    <h3>I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing <br>should go on</h3>
    <h3>and on</h3>
    <h3>and if writing should go on</h3>
    <h3>what had <span class="h3bold">colons</span> and <span class="h3bold">commas</span> to do with it,</h3>
    <h3>what had <span class="h3bold">periods</span> to do with it</h3>
    <h3>what had <span class="h3bold">small letters</span> and <span class="h3bold">capitals</span> to do with it</h3>
    <h3>to do with writing going on which was at that time the most profound need I had in connection with writing.</h3>
    <h3>What had <span class="h3bold">colons</span> and <span class="h3bold">semi-colons</span> to do with it what had <span class="h3bold">commas</span> to do with it what had <span class="h3bold">periods</span> to do with it.</h3>
