    <h3>And now what does a <span class="h3bold">comma</span> do and what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about them.</h3>
    <h3>What does a <span class="h3bold">comma</span> do.</h3>
    <h3>I have refused them so often </h3>
    <h3>and left the out so much and did without them so continually that I have come finally to be indifferent to them. </h3>
    <h3>I do not now care whether you put them in or not </h3>
    <h3>but for a long time I felt very definitely about them </h3>
    <h3>and would have nothing to do with them.</h3>
    <h3>As I say <span class="h3bold">commas</span> are servile </h3>
    <h3>and they have no life of their own, </h3>
    <h3>and their use is not a use, </h3>
    <h3>it is a way of replacing one's own interest </h3>
    <h3>and I do decidedly like to like my own interest my own interest in what I am doing. </h3>
    <h3>A <span class="h3bold">comma</span> by helping you along holding your coat for you and putting on your shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it and to me for many years and I still do feel that way about it only now I do not pay as much attention to them, </h3>
    <h3>the use of them was positively degrading. </h3>
    <h3>Let me tell you what I feel </h3>
    <h3>and what I mean </h3>
    <h3>and what I felt </h3>
    <h3>and what I meant.</h3>
    <h3>When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans,</h3>
    <h3>verbs active present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me. </h3>
    <h3>I have told you that I recognize verbs </h3>
    <h3>and adverbs </h3>
    <h3>aided by prepositions </h3>
    <h3>and conjunctions </h3>
    <h3>with pronouns </h3>
    <h3>as possessing the whole of the active life of writing.</h3>
        
    <h3>Complications make eventually for simplicity </h3>
    <h3>and therefore I have always liked dependent adverbial clauses. </h3>
        
    <h3>I have like dependent adverbial clauses because of their variety of dependence and independence. </h3>
    <h3>You can see how loving the intensity of complication of these things that <span class="h3bold">commas</span> would be degrading. </h3>
        
    <h3>Why if you want the pleasure of concentrating on the final simplicity of excessive complication </h3>
    <h3>would you want any artificial aid to bring about that simplicity. </h3>
    <h3>Do you see now why I feel about that simplicity. </h3>
    <h3>Do you see now why I feel about the <span class="h3bold">comma</span> as I did and as I do.</h3>
        
    <h3>Think about anything you really like to do </h3>
    <h3>and you will see what I mean.</h3>
        
    <h3>When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut the knot, </h3>
    <h3>at least of anybody feels who is working with any thread, </h3>
    <h3>so anybody feels who is working with any tool </h3>
    <h3>so anybody feels who is writing any sentence </h3>
    <h3>or reading it after it has been written. </h3>
        
    <h3>And what does a <span class="h3bold">comma</span> do, </h3>
    <h3>a <span class="h3bold">comma</span> does nothing but make easy a thing that if you like it enough is easy enough without the comma. </h3>
    <h3>A long complicated sentence should force itself upon you, </h3>
    <h3>make you know yourself knowing it and the <span class="h3bold">comma</span>, </h3>
    <h3>well at the most a <span class="h3bold">comma</span> is a poor period that lets you stop </h3>
    <h3>and take a breath </h3>
    <h3>but if you want to take a breath </h3>
    <h3>you ought to know yourself that you want to take a breath. </h3>
    <h3>,</h3>
        
    <h3>It is not like stopping altogether has something to do with going on,</h3> 
    <h3>but taking a breath well </h3>
    <h3>you are always taking a breath </h3>
    <h3>and why emphasize one breath rather than another breath. </h3>
        
    <h3>Anyway that is the way I felt about it </h3>
    <h3>and I felt that about it very very strongly. </h3>
    <h3>And so I almost never used a <span class="h3bold">comma</span>. </h3>
    <h3>The longer, </h3>
    <h3>the more complicated the sentence </h3>
    <h3>the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following one after another, </h3>
    <h3>the more </h3>
    <h3>the very more I had of them </h3>
    <h3>the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves </h3>
    <h3>by themselves and not helping them, </h3>
    <h3>and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a <span class="h3bold">comma</span>.</h3>
