    <h3>You can see what an entirely different thing a period is from a <span class="h3bold">comma</span>, a <span class="h3bold">colon</span> or a <span class="h3bold">semi-colon</span>.</h3>
    <h3>There are two different way of thinking about <span class="h3bold">colons</span> and <span class="h3bold">semicolons</span></h3>
    <h3>you can think of them as <span class="h3bold">commas</span> and as such they are purely servile </h3>
    <h3>or you can think of them as <span class="h3bold">periods</span> and then using them can make you feel adventurous </h3>
    <h3>aI can see that one might feel about them as <span class="h3bold">periods</span> </h3>
    <h3>but I myself never have, </h3>
    <h3>I began unfortunately to feel them as a <span class="h3bold">comma</span></h3>
    <h3>and <span class="h3bold">commas</span> are servile they have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and convenience and they are put there just for practical purposes. </h3>
    <h3 class="front">;-;</h3>
    <h3><span class="h3bold">Semi-colons</span> and <span class="h3bold">colons</span> had for me from the first completely this character</h3>
    <h3>the character that a comma has and not the character that a <span class="h3bold">period</span> has</h3>
    <h3>and therefore</h3>
    <h3>and definitely I have never used them.</h3>
    <h3>But now dimly and definitely I do see that they might well possibly they might have in them something of the character of the period</h3>
    <h3>and so it might have been an adventure to use them.</h3>
    <h3>I really do not think so. </h3>
    <h3>I think however lively they are </h3>
    <h3>or disguised they are </h3>
    <h3>they are definitely more comma than <span class="h3bold">period</span> </h3>
    <h3>and so really I cannot regret not having used them. </h3>
    <h3>They are more powerful </h3>
    <h3>more imposing </h3>
    <h3>more pretentious </h3>
    <h3>than a <span class="h3bold">comma</span> but they are a <span class="h3bold">comma</span> all the same. </h3>
    <h3>They really have within them deeply </h3>
    <h3>within them fundamentally within them the <span class="h3bold">comma</span> nature.</h3>
